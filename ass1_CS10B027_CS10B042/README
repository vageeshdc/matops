CSD assignment 1

Authors: Pankaj Kumar (cs10b042),Vageesh D C(cs10b027)

General compilation:
1. $ nasm -f elf <file name>
2. $ gcc -o <executable> <file_name.o>
3. $ ./<executable>

Running:
	1. multiplication
		$ make
		$ ./matmul_row #for row major
		$ ./matmul_col #for column major
		$ clean

	2.inverse
		$ make
		$ ./inverse
		$ clean

Usage:
1. Matrix multiplication:
	The matrices values must be filled into the variables corresponding to AAA, BBB for matrices A and B respectively - hardcoded
	The executable produced runs without any input but outputs the cycles elapsed for computation and the resultant matrix
	Output to stdout in integer base 10
	Runtime: 162040 cycles for row major and 122352 for col major

2. Inverse:
	This requires the user to input a 3x3 matrix in row major form by entering the elements one after another - input via stdin
	The inverse is printed out to stdout in base 10
	Runtime: 118348 cycles

Work division:
	1. Matrix multiplication: Row major implemented by Vageesh and column major by Pankaj
	2. Inverse implemented by Pankaj and Vageesh
	3. The design was discussed and implemented together
